# VBA-challenge solution
This Challenge involved summarising and analysing generated stock market data. A script is created that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

-	Ticker symbol
-	Yearly change
-	Percentage change
-	Total stock volume

In addition, the script returns the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease and the greatest total volume. The script is able to run on every worksheet at once.
